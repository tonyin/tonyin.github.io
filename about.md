> Do something every day that makes your brain hurt, your muscles sore, your friends blessed, and your spirit soar.
&mdash;*Tony Yin*

I was born in Canada, spent a large part of my childhood in South Bend, IN, as well as Pullman, WA. I spent almost 8 years in Chicago, IL for some very formative education and work experience. I am currently slumming it in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I enjoy coming up with and prototyping new ideas. Message me if you'd like to chat: t@tonyy.in
