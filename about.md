I was born in Canada, spent a large part of my childhood in South Bend, IN, and then later Pullman, WA. I spent almost 8 years in Chicago, IL for some very formative education and work experience. I am currently slumming it in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I enjoy coming up with and prototyping new ideas. Get in touch if you'd like to chat! <a href="mailto:t@tonyy.in">t@tonyy.in</a>
