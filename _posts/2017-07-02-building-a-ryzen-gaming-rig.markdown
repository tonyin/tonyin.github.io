My hands felt worn. There was the slight tingling and calloused sensation from a hard day's labor with ones hands. On the one hand, I had none of the soft and lotioned sensitivity of a lazy wealthy elite. On the other, a farmer or weightlifter would barely have noticed. No, my hands were something in-between; skin just thick enough to handle a moderate week of typing and mouse-clicks and grasping and lifting and once-or-twice-a-week pull-ups (more than 40 of which are done in one session). But skin sensitive enough to _feel_ after moving and lifting and screwing and prying modular computer components for a few hours after dark.

And it _felt good_. Best I've slept in weeks.

Here are the specs:

- AMD Ryzen 5 1600X (*CPU*)
- Cooler Master Hyper, T4 AM4-Compatible out-of-box (*CPU Cooler*)
- MSI B350M Gaming Pro (*Motherboard*)
- Gigabyte NVidia GeForce GTX 1080 Windforce OC 8G (*Graphics*)
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 2 x 8GB DDR4-3000 (*Memory*)
- Samsung 960 Evo 250GB M.2 SSD (*Storage*)
- EVGA SuperNova NEX 650W PSU (*Power*)
- Phanteks Eclipse P400 Black (*Case*)
- Acer H277HU 27" 1440p 60Hz IPS kmipuz (*Monitor*)

By far the most useful site for building a new desktop computer is the site [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com). You can browse builds by other people, build guides, ratings and reviews, and importantly, compatibility issues.

###### The Monitor

I have a 2016 MacBook Pro with USB-C, so the built-in USB-C plug is amazingly convenient. Video, audio, keyboard, mouse, all can be transmitted through one simple cable. Instant "desktop" experience for my MBP. As advanced as a custom built rig is, however, neither of the video connections available, HDMI and DisplayPort, can carry through USB peripherals. My keyboard and mouse therefore need to be moved off the monitor and into the rig directly when I want to switch. Someone needs to figure this out.
