## Summary
Elastos is a cross-blockchain “OS of Internet” platform that connects different auxiliary blockchain platforms, of which [NEO](http://neo.org/) is one. The Elastos “parent” blockchain provides identity and networking services backed by "merged mining" with Bitcoin blockchain. **Dubbed the “blockchain aircraft carrier”**.

	* Stores IDs for authentication
* **Elastos Carrier**
	* UDP-based NAT traversal for node network connection
	* Foundational decentralized services: domain names, computation, storage
* **Elastos OS**

## Economics

* 33,000,000 million ELAs (33,000,000,000,000 trillion SELAs)
* 1 SELA = 0.00000001 ELA
* 4% inflation, generated via new blocks every 2 minutes
* First two years, mined ELAs allocated 30% Elastos Foundation 70% miners
* 16.5M ELA (50% of premine supply) airdropped to BTC holders on exchanges
* Presale Aug 2017: 6M ELA released for 4000 BTC (equivalent to $10 USD /ELA assuming BTC $14500)

> **Market Cap: $10 * 33M = $330M**
