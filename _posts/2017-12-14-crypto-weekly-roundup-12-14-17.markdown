## Market shrugs

The overall crypto bull market continues — the [combined market cap has increased 25%](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) from $400M to $500M in the last 7 days. Ethereum founder [Vitalik Buterin is reflective](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/940744724431982594) and admonishes our enthusiasm. The Market shrugged.

## Charlie Lee Spree
[Charlie Lee](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite), creator of Litecoin, goes on a [media spree](https://youtu.be/gzx2RaMZ-Ps), which may or may not have caused a massive spike in LTC from [$100 to $340](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) at its peak. We all know LTC is like a mini-Bitcoin, but did you know it also [has SegWit and successful Lightning transfers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin)? Coinbase buyers probably don’t care.

## Bitcoin DGAF
CBOE Bitcoin futures (XBT) began trading and immediately [crashed the CBOE site](https://twitter.com/CBOE/status/940001581482815498), as well as Coinbase’s exchange GDAX. Bitcoin had a small pop but overall [futures volume](http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures) has been low. Look out for CME Bitcoin futures this week on the 18th, which are [heavier in contract size](https://danjpark.com/bitcoin-futures-explained/) but, if CBOE is any indication, shouldn’t dramatically affect the overall Bitcoin market.

## SEC Munchees
SEC chairman [publishes a note](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11) on crypto and ICOs, reiterating caution for investors but acknowledging that they are “effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects.” His team subsequently [cracks down on the $15M Munchee ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/sec-halts-multimillion-dollar-munchee-ico-securities-violations/) who had to refund all proceeds back to investors. It's okay though, no one wanted [another food review app](https://munchee.io) anyway!

See you guys next week!
