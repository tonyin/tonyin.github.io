## Metrics
[Total Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/): $463 billion (-14% w/w)<br />
[MC 7-Day High-Low Range](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/): $165 billion (+11% w/w)<br />
[Bitcoin Dominance](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage): 33.9% (-0.4 w/w)

General doom and gloom this week around expected further regulation, as well as USDT nervousness. There was hope somewhere in the world however as I spent two days at NEO DevCon listening to the grand vision to [make NEO the #1 blockchain by 2020](https://twitter.com/caterina_zhang/status/958398778498674688).. then Thursday morning happened. The market is still bloody red; hang in there everyone.

## NEM Hack
[Coincheck](https://coincheck.com/), one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, was [hacked for $400 million USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/cryptocurrencies-drop-after-japanese-exchange-halts-withdrawals) last week in what is considered the largest crypto theft ever. Hackers stole 500+ million coins of [NEM](https://nem.io/) ([$XEM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nem/)), a Japan-based smart asset blockchain and perennial top 10 by market cap; the official NEM foundation has [tagged the stolen coins](https://blog.nem.io/nem-protocol-tracks-funds-stolen-from-coincheck-exchange/) to monitor their movement and alert exchanges if they are attempted to be sold. The short term impact was a 10% drop and quick rebound thanks to the swift tagging, but continuing to track the coins will get more difficult as the hackers [begin spreading the coins out](https://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Currencies/Coincheck-hackers-move-cryptocurrency-to-stymie-recovery) to others. Coincheck has [promised to recoup](http://corporate.coincheck.com/2018/01/28/30.html) all affected customers in JPY and halted new registrations for now.

## Litecoin + Monero
[Charlie Lee](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite), founder of Litecoin ($[LTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/)), [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/957139108547067904) a partnership proposal to Monero ($[XMR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/)) founder [Riccardo Spagni](https://twitter.com/fluffypony). The proposal was to make “[on-chain atomic swaps](https://themerkle.com/what-is-an-atomic-swap/)” easy to do between LTC and XMR, creating an easy and liquid p2p market for the two coins. The [purported primary benefit](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/957139266752020480) for LTC holders is access to XMR’s anonymity, and for XMR holders easy access to LTC's liquidity (Charlie has lately been back on a media spree advocating for [payments via Litecoin](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/959143299050127360)). Charlie and Riccardo are [animal pals](https://twitter.com/magicalcrypto) so this is actually not an unlikely scenario.

## Bitfinex and Tether Subpoena’ed
[Word came out](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc) about a United States CFTC subpoena sent to Bitfinex and Tether, the infamous company behind $[USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/). Except that the subpoena was sent almost two months ago on Dec. 6, so the short term cause for alarm was just another day in our jumpy world of crypto.

## Facebook Bans Crypto Ads
Renowned crypto hustler [James Altucher](https://twitter.com/jaltucher) (could give [McAfee](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee) a run for his money), as well as ICOs of varyingly quality, have both seemingly made fortunes plastering ads all over Facebook. On Tuesday [Facebook said no more](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-ads-policy-improving-integrity-and-security-of-financial-product-and-services-ads). Ads like “binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency” are “frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices”. The move is a small sacrifice to Facebook’s revenue but a noble one as we continue to mull over how best to prevent the next Bitconnect. My only concern is how will I find binary option courses now??

See you guys next week —
