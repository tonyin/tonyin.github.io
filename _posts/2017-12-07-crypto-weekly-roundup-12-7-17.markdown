## Bitcoin
Holy shit [BTC is at $16k](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) at the time of writing. Last week it had just crossed $10k. Things keep getting crazier and there's no end in sight. Up next: [CME](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/bitcoin-futures.html) and [CBOE](http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures) listing BTC futures (easy access for main/wallet street investors). Wildcard is that you will be able to short BTC (sell futures which are cash-settled). As per past trends, when BTC surges, alt coins drop as the BTC black hole sucks in capital. Expect capital to flow back to alts if/when BTC settles. Sites like Coinbase and Binance keep crashing due to the volume.

## CryptoKitties
Speaking of crashing, the Ethereum network spiked ([continues to spike](https://etherscan.io/)) to record high transaction throughput due to the newest Beanie Baby / Neopets / Pokemon phenomenon [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). The internet and YouTube were made for cats but it seems blockchain is as well, and kitties can do no wrong in this world. [Gen 0 kitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/marketplace/gen0) are going for $$$ and the [OG kitty](https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/1) was [sold for 246 ETH](https://twitter.com/CryptoKitties/status/937058830143254528) ($100k+) a few days ago. CK is a true test for the Ethereum network. Many newcomers, entranced by the cuteness, have [lost Gas](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoKitties/comments/7i462l/tips_for_new_playersnoobsnon_tech_kids_dont_waste/) (ETH unit) trying to push their txs through with too low of fees. Casper Proof-of-Stake canâ€™t come soon enough.

## Hacks
The latest in a series of high profile hacks, enter the popular distributed mining pool software [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/). The mining site was taken down for almost 48 hours for ostensible "maintenance" before an [official announcement](https://www.nicehash.com/) was made about the hack. $63M+ USD was taken and sits at [bitcoin address 1EnJHhq8Jq8vDuZA5ahVh6H4t6jh1mB4rq](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1EnJHhq8Jq8vDuZA5ahVh6H4t6jh1mB4rq). [Redditors suspect foul play](https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceHash/comments/7i0s6o/official_press_release_statement_by_nicehash/dqvaq8x/).

## Iota
[Iota](https://iota.org/) has seen massive massive volume in the past week. We first heard rustlings a few of weeks back when they demonstrated a [real-time air quality monitor in Taiwan](https://twitter.com/jserv/status/930771971519873025) built on their blockchain. Since then, exchanges like Binance have been swarmed as IOT pops from a historic 10-15 market cap spot to [#4 this week](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/).
