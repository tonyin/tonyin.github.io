We all know the importance of training our physical bodies every week, like working out at the gym or going for a run. Making our muscles sore, however, is only one part of the equation for [living a happy and healthy life](https://tonyy.in/do-these-4-things-every-day/). The other three pillars are developing your mind, your spirit, and your social being.

I heard about [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) way back in college. Since then, it has given me a convenient, interesting, and useful outlet for making my brain hurt, the key to developing your mind; great for when I spend all day in meetings, for example, and get no tangible work done (of course, my brain hurts in different ways from being in meetings all day). I've [completed 37 of the problems](https://github.com/tonyin/project-euler/) so far, the first 21 in R and subsequent ones in Python. Some reasons for why you should get started:

- **Learn a new coding language**. <br /> I did the first 21 problems in R because I wanted to get familiar with the syntax and libraries. I find the best way to learn something is to just start using it in real projects. <br /><br />
- **Learn mathematical concepts**. <br /> Know what the [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is? Neither did I until a brute force solution took more than 3 minutes to run, and I needed a better algorithm for solving the problem. Good topics for cocktail parties. <br /><br />
- **Improve your algorithmic thinking**. <br /> Your first approach to solving a problem will most likely be a brute force solution. Moore's Law may have enabled beefy computers in our pockets, but O(n^2) implementations will still make your computer's brain hurt. Help it out with your own problem-solving brain.<br /><br />
