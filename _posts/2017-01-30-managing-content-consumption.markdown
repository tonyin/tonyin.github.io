There's a lot of good content on the internet these days. Twitter, LinkedIn, email newsletters, Pocket, Refind, blogs, community forums.. all of these channels offer a steady stream of content for us to wade through. It can get overwhelming though, especially if you try to consume everything you find on the spot. Thankfully there are fantastic tools for managing all of this content, from storage to retrieval to reminders. Having a system in place allows you to sift through the best content for optimal use in your life. Below are the pieces of my own system for content consumption management and the best tools I've found for them.

- **Save for later reading**: [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) <br /> Unless you're in the zone and can spend a few hours reading various articles, blog posts, and other long form, you need some way to save something for later. Pocket is a simple concept that embraces convenience of your time - you save anything you want into Pocket, and read what you saved at your leisure. I am constantly saving things and have dedicated downtime (eg. when I am commuting) to work through my reading list. Pocket is also getting better at content discovery and sharing features as they evolve their social platform. <br /><br />
- **Save for later reference**: [Refind](https://refind.com/) <br /> Remember delicious, the bookmarking site? Refind is just like that but with a better user experience. Anything I come across that would be useful for later reference, like a [startup tools playbook](https://founderkit.com/), I can save to Refind. The advantage over regular old bookmarks is that Refind saved content is inherently social and organized with crowdsourced tagging, nice for when I am looking for a general topic. Discovery, sharing, and retrieval are all there and have a nice UI reminiscent of Medium. <br /><br />
- **Remember stuff**: [Harvest](https://tonyy.in/harvest/) <br /> I made this Chrome Extension to help me remember everything I read online. Harvest uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) for optimal memory - anytime I come across a great quote or other valuable insight, I "plant" it on Harvest and get reminder emails spaced throughout the future. <br /><br />

There are lots of solutions for dealing with the above use cases - people use Twitter favorites for saving posts, or private bookmarks for reference material, or pen & paper for remembering stuff. I have to save Chinese articles to my Google Inbox instead of Pocket since I need a mouse-hover translator extension to help with reading, and you can't do that on a phone. The above three tools, however, form the core of what I use day to day.

Give those tools a try and find me on their social networks.
