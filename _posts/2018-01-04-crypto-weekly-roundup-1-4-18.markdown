## Metrics

[Total Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/): $761 billion (+34% w/w)

<br />

## Ripple and Rockets
All around insane week for many top “altcoins” (non-Bitcoin), especially protocol coins —

* [Cardano ADA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/) +190% w/w
* [Stellar XLM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/) +269% w/w
* [Tron TRX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) +412% w/w
* [Neo NEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/) +72% w/w

— but [Ripple XRP](https://ripple.com/) really shook headlines as the coin, an [oft-maligned](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7mxbiq/warning_you_dont_own_anything_of_actual_value/) project for being centralized, overtook Ethereum for the [#2 spot](https://coinmarketcap.com/) by market cap (and #1 by [total supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/views/market-cap-by-total-supply/)). XRP went from $1.47 and $57 billion market cap to $3.56 and $138 billion. Possible reasons for the jump: Coinbase addition rumors, [Koreans](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ripple/#markets), and hedge funds (?).

### Cardano
Redditors [are concerned](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7o09kj/cardano_which_currently_has_no_working_product_is/) that Cardano, a recent market favorite for its high degree of peer-reviewed technical concepts, is now worth more than SpaceX by market cap. ADA is a classic "whitepaper" project (no product except for a whitepaper).

### Stellar
[Someone dug up](https://twitter.com/lsukernik/status/948656328632922117) a gem about [Stripe](http://stripe.com/) (a real-world online payments company) lending Stellar $3M in 2014, which was [repaid with 2 billion XLM coins](https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/#Lumen_distribution). Each XLM token is currently worth $0.80 (that’s a cool $1.6 billion repayment).

### Tron
Charlie Lee (Founder of Litecoin) [calls out](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/948820253034758144) Tron as mostly hype, and Justin Sun (Founder of Tron) [strikes back](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/948966939245797376) about Charlie selling all his LTC. Crypto Twitter is the best Twitter.

<br />

## The Neo Ecosystem
A [G3 (NEO + Elastos + Bitmain) Summit](https://neonewstoday.com/events/g3-summit-event-report/) was held in China yesterday discussing blockchain technology and project visions. NEO hit $100 later that night as, along with general market exuberance, traders anticipate a [slew of ICOs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g21tYH2ctNqapcP4W-_WWLqF2SODB7FNakeXpDLTlYc) on the NEP5 protocol. NEP5 [coin returns](https://neoblockcha.in/nep5) have been great so far.

<br />

## US Closes Like-Kind Tax Election
As the new year rolls around, crypto traders are [up in arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5VCq3pX3ys) (in the USA, at least) about the latest tax bill, specifically Section 1031 which [closes a gray area](https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/bad-news-crypto-investors-new-us-tax-bill/) around reporting crypto-crypto trades as “like-kind” and thus deferring capital gains or losses. Popular places to move with more favorable tax laws include Germany and Hong Kong.

A perhaps coincidental theme around the rise of many coins this week is their low and often sub-$1 nominal value (as opposed to total market cap). Remember folks, there’s more to a coin than its nominal price.

See you guys next week —
