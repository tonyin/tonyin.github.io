## Summary

Zeepin is a digital asset rights platform for the creative industry. The platform focuses on the entire lifecycle of creative assets — from digitization to utilization to compensation. While sparse on technical details, the project has two huge factors going for it: Onchain and NEO partnership, and the Arting365 community. It also doesn’t hurt to have a beautiful website and YouTube intro videos (as expected from a creatives project!).

> **Zeepin is another key piece in the NEO smart economy, focusing on digital asset rights and usage. Expensive valuation at $109.2M USD implied market cap.**

<br />

## Partnerships
[Onchain](http://www.onchain.com/en-us/) and [NEO](https://neo.org/) — Arguably the most important piece to the entire project as the Onchain Mafia will not let them fail

[Arting365](http://arting365.com/) — Community of purportedly 1.2 million designers that would be an instant community of users for Zeepin. [SimilarWeb stats](https://www.similarweb.com/website/arting365.com)

> **Onchain Mafia.. ‘nuff said.**

<br />

## Technology
**Zeepin Platform**

* Based on DNAProject (Onchain)
* Supports multilayered and private blockchains
* “Credit Score” to encourage positive content and behavior
  * Can be exchanged for Zeepin Token (ZPT)
  * Used to increased “credit rating”
  * All projects evaluated by Zeepin Foundation or third-parties, evaluation compensated in ZPT; projects that do not pass evaluation will not be allowed to execute

**Zeepin Chain** — Underlying blockchain on NEO platform

**ZeeRights** — Digitize and record creative assets for copyright and tradability. The core dApp of the entire Zeepin ecosystem.

  * Copyright Pro — Validated certification of ownership
  * Authorization Pro — Transaction authorization and smart contract clauses such as profit distribution

**ZeeSure** —  Asset insurance. Ensure protection of copyright (Q: How to enforce?). Also provides real-world legal consultation (Q: How does this model work?)

  * “Reputation” (or integrity, credibility) impacted by violations of copyright
  * Mechanisms and procedures for reporting and reviewing content infringement; violations subject to account and IP suspension (Note: this sounds like a centralized governing structure)
  * “Credit Score” and ZPT can be locked up or destroyed

**ZeeProof** — “Zero-knowledge proof” of copyright existence without revealing contents

**ZeeCrew** — Platform for forming DAOs

**Zeepin Name Service** — Human-readable name service

**Zeepin Token (ZPT)**

  * Medium of exchange
  * Vote for improvements to Zeepin Platform and other Zeepin dApps (except there is no technical or legal binding for vote results; end decision entirely up to Zeepin Foundation)
  * Maintain Zeepin Platform (?)

**ZeeTalent** — Digital identity for each user. Uses external authentication and KYC (eg. TheKey?)

**ZeeFund** — Crowdfunding for projects, paid in ZPT

> **Minimal technical details and more a list of dApps and use cases that the Zeepin Platform plans to provide. Tackles a number of different problems but the core product is ZeeRights for digital asset rights and usage.**

## Economics
* 1 billion ZPT
  * 50% crowdsale, 20% community development, 20% team, 10% R&D
* 500 million ZPT sold in crowdsale
  * Proceeds: 50% development, 20% operations, 15% marketing, 15% Board of Directors and fees
* Hard cap: 700,000 NEO
	* [Update](https://medium.com/@zeepin/annoucement-136ec03468c0): Hard cap at $42M USD if 1 NEO < $100 USD, or at 420k NEO if 1 NEO > $100 USD
	* At time of writing, NEO is $130 which means hard cap is $54.6M USD
* 10% inflation starting year two, decreasing inflation thereafter

> **Hard cap of $54.6M USD means implied MC of $109.2M USD. Expensive for a new project pre-Mainnet.**
